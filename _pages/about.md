## About Me

I am a PhD candidate at the Department of [Computer and Information Science](https://umdearborn.edu/cecs) at the University of Michigan-Dearborn advised by Dr. [Niccol√≤ Meneghetti](https://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~niccolom/research/). My background includes software engineering and research experience across machine learning, systems, software optimization, and parallel computing. I am always eager to learn and grow.

**Research areas:** My research integrates Bayesian machine learning into database cores to natively handle uncertain and probabilistic data. I enable databases to perform statistical reasoning directly, managing uncertainty and delivering reliable insights from complex, incomplete data. To achieve this, I work at the intersection of data management, machine learning, and probabilistic programming. I develop query execution engines that bridge relational queries and Bayesian inference while maintaining high performance.
