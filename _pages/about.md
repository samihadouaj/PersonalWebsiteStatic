I am a PhD candidate in Rackham Graduate School at the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. I work in the Database research lab under the supervision of professor Niccolo Meneghetti. I have a software engineering education as well as research experience in machine learning, systems, software optimization, parallel computing and more, as I am always willing to learn and evolve.

**Research areas:** My research is focused on integrating Bayesian machine learning into database cores to natively handle uncertain and probabilistic data. My goal is to enable databases to perform statistical reasoning natively, so they can manage uncertainty and provide more reliable insights from complex and incomplete data. To realize this vision, I work at the intersection of data management and machine learning and probabilistic programming, developing new query execution engines that bridge the gap between relational queries and Bayesian inference
while maintaining high performance.
